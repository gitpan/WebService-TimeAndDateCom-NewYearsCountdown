DESCRIPTION
    Module obtains count downs until New Years from www.timeanddate.com.

NOTICE TO THE USER
    It's worth noting that www.timeanddate.com has this message at the top
    of its HTML code:

        scripts and programs that download content transparent to
        the user are not allowed without permission

    ...I'm not 100% sure about its meaning.

METHODS
  "new"
        my $hny = WebService::TimeAndDateCom::NewYearsCountdown->new;

    Constructs and returns a new
    "WebService::TimeAndDateCom::NewYearsCountdown" object. Does not take
    any arguments.

  "hny"
        my $all_timezones_data = $hny->hny
            or die $hny->error;

        my $data = $hny->hny('EST')
            or die $hny->error;

    "hny" stands for Happy New Year. Takes one optional argument, which is
    the time zone for which to retrieve the data; valid time zones are
    listed below. On failure returns an "undef" or an empty list, depending
    on the context, and the reason for error will be available using the
    "->error" method. On success returns New Years countdown data. If the
    time zone is specified, returns a single hashref for that time zone,
    otherwise returns an arrayref of hashrefs of data for each time zone.
    The format of the hashrefs is as follows:

        {
            'tz' => 'EST',
            'time_left' => '4 days, 02:10:04',
            'countries' => 'regions of U.S.A., regions of Canada and 12 more',
            'cities' => 'New York, Washington DC, Detroit, Havana'
        }

    *   "tz" time zone code

    *   "time_left" time until New Years in that time zone

    *   "countries" a brief list of regions/countries in that time zone

    *   "cities" a brief list of cities in that time zone
